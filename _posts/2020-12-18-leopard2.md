This video shows a 1/6 scale Leopard 2 lower hull built 10 years ago with new power set (motors and gearbox) made nowadays. Due to the heavy chassis, it is still not fast and agile enough, but will be improved in later version we are going to make.


### track links

steel alloy, casted 10 years ago, contains lots of Mn, and the rubber is vulcanized.

### story

This lower hull was done 10 years ago, at around 2011, the very first work, like most tank modellers, this is the "Leopard 2 complex"; "how hard could it be" that's the thought before making it. Then it turns out a tricky mission, loads of problems during every process.

It stopped after the sheet metal of the turret is done.

But we always hope to finish this project, and now is the time.

The lower hull is taken out of the garage, and before making new, better lower hull, we want to test a new power set. You could see from the image below, brand new brushless motors with beautifully custom made gearboxs - and it could change gears.  You could check the result in the video above.
